# High-Performance Computing : CPU Heat dissipation simulation

This project aims to simulate the heat dissipation of a CPU heatsink using a finite-elements discretisation. The FEM has configurable spatial and time steps. The dimensions and constituting materials of the modeled CPU and Heatsink can be configured as desired. The latter's constituting materials can be configured as well.
The parallelisation of the simulation code is done on CPU using the `OpenMPI` library. The code is properly commented ; however, french-speaking readers are advised to take a deeper look into the project's logical structure by reading the `FRENCH_REPORT.pdf` file.
